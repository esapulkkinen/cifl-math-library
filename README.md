# cifl-math-library
Basic mathematics library

Documentation is at https://esapulkkinen.github.io/cifl-math-library/

Compilation should occur when you do:

  $ make

Compilation requires the following additional software:
   GNU Make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>
   stack <https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/>
   cabal <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/>
   sed <https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/>

Many modules from hackage.haskell.org are used.

For SIMD support, GHC >= 8.0, clang and llvm are needed.
