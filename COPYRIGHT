There are portions that I have read from internet from various places
and by nature of the library's use of the data must be incorporated to
the Haskell code. These portions are allowed to be copied also under
their original author's license. I have tried to insert comment on the
portion of code that is obtained from or based on such sources and
included URL, link or reference to the corresponding place and add a
reference or copy of the corresponding license in this file. The code
contains many such references. Usually they are visible in the
automatically generated documentation as well, but to be sure to find
all of them, please read the actual Haskell code.

Due to nature of basic mathematical theory, very few portions of the
code contain original mathematics. I do not attempt to claim to have
invented any such basic theory such as what is found in basic linear
algebra, category theory or graph theory or other such well known part
of mathematics.

With respect to many modules in Math.Graph package, and occasionally
in other modules as well, the book
"Lawvere, Rosebrugh: Sets for mathematics", ISBN 0-521-01060-8
has been an invaluable resource.

Portions are based on Haskell standard library and its implementation
in the GHC compiler as described in GHC documentation.
